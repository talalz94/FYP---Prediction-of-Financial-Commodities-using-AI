There will be two sub-tasks: an expression-level task and a message-level task; participants may choose to participate in either or both tasks.
 
- Task A: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation
Given a message containing a marked instance of a word or phrase, determine whether that instance is positive, negative or neutral in that context.
 
- Task B: Message Polarity Classification
Given a message, classify whether the message is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. For messages conveying both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen.
